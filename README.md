# DJ & A-V Equipment Inventory Management System

## Project Overview

The application is designed to manage shared DJ and A-V equipment by tracking inventory items, equipment availability, and check-in/check-out activity.  
The system provides a centralized way to record which equipment is available, who has borrowed items, and a historical log of all equipment usage.

## Problem Addressed

Managing shared DJ and A-V equipment using spreadsheets, paper logs, or messages makes it difficult to:

- Know which equipment is currently available
- Track who has borrowed equipment and when
- Maintain accountability and usage history

This application solves these issues by providing a structured inventory and checkout tracking system backed by a relational database.

## Core Features

- Add, edit, and delete equipment items
- View a complete inventory list with availability status
- Create user (borrower) records
- Check equipment out
- Check equipment back in
- Prevent invalid actions (e.g., double checkout)
- Maintain a historical log of all check-in and check-out activity
